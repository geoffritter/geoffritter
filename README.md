Hello! I'm Geoff!

I have a wide background from Quality Assurance, to Web Development, and now systems administration and I.T. work. I love solving problems and wroking things out. While I.T. is my focus right now, I likely would like to be somewhere back in web development.

Primarally I work with Windows and Linux on the server side and have done personal development work with both, generally small personal projects or proof of concept things.
